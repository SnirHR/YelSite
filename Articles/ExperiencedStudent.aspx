<h2>3. Practice Problem-Solving:</h2>

    Each mistake is a learning opportunity. After each game, take the time to review your play. Identify any mistakes or poor decisions and consider what you could have done differently. Learning from your mistakes helps you avoid repeating them in the future.
</p>
<h2>5. Stay Informed of Bridge Strategies:</h2>

    Stay updated on the latest Bridge strategies and theories. Read books, attend seminars, or follow Bridge blogs. Understanding and implementing these strategies can improve your game and enhance your logical thinking skills.
